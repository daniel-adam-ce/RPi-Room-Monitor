# RPi-Room-Monitor
Raspberry Pi Room Monitor System with two main features: temperature display and camera human montoring system.

The system consists of two Raspberry Pi's, one that acts as a server for the temperature sensor (Waveshare BME280), and one that acts as the main display (LCD 800x480 touch screen). The display has a GUI that displays the current temperature, as well as a color-coded graph of the past hour of temperature readings. Additionally, the main Pi also has a USB camera attached to it that is used to detect humans outside the door of the room using cv2, tensorflow, and a light weight object detection model (SSD Mobilenet V2). When a human is detected, LEDs will flash red around the main Pi and an interrupt will be sent to the display process to display the frame with the detected object.
